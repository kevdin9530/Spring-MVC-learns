You can either use XML file to set config for ur Spring MVC
or you can configure with java code. Example is DemoAppConfig and 
MySpringMvcDispatcherServletInitializer

Developing Controller and Views - Development Process: 
- Create controller class
- Define controller method
- Add request mapping to controller method
- return view name
- development view page

To create controller class. simply create a class and add Anno @Controller
To define controller method, go to your controller class, create a method
with any name u like and your return can be any type too. However
you need to add @RequestMapping("") to define the URL for your controller

in the example, the controller will return a string but according to our
configuration file, the name return will add suffix-prefix and find the
path to that file accordingly.

We need to create a page for the main-menu example
It can be any regular html or jsp file

OBS! NOTE TO SELF. Remember to config context component scan on right package path

Now we going to learn how to read form data with Spring MVC
development process:
- create controller class
- show html form (create controller method to show html form and create 
view page for HTMl form)
- process html form(create controller and development view page for html form)


Now we are going to adding data to spring model
The Model is a container for your app data
In your controller code: 
- You can put anything in the model
- string,object, info from db...
and your view page (JSP) can access the data from the model.

Code example: 
- create new method to access form data
- read the form data
- convert the data
- add new version of the data to the model.

to access resources simply add the following in your spring config file
<mvc:resources mapping="/resources/**" location="/resources/"></mvc:resources>

for your view page, example of adding resources:
<img src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/images/spring-logo.png">
There is a exampleHTMLCSS.txt which u can check out.


Reading HTML Form Data with @RequestParam Annotation
- create a method to process form data
- read form data
- convert data
- add new data version to the model 

Add controller, request mapping. 
by doing this you can:
- serves as parent mapping for the controller
- all request mappings on methods in the controller are relative
- similar to folder directory structure
For practice we will add another controller
In this case, we will encounter an error 500. By checking the
 log or console. We can see it said root cause: Ambiguous mapping.
 Basically it means that we cant use it becuz it already in use.
 So to differ one controller to another, you need to add a
 RequestMapping above your controller class and define different
 directory.
 
/////////////////////// Spring MVC form tag////////////////////

basically, html form are used to get input from the user and this time
we will learn the form with spring.
Spring MVC Form Tags are the building block for web page
Form tag are configurable and reusable for a web page

Spring MVC Form tag can make use of DATA BINDING and it allows 
to automatically set/retrieve data from java object/bean

The form tag will create html for the user
To know more about spring mvc form tag
go to: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.0.2.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-view-jsp-tags

As for the web structure, u can use a normal jsp page
and simply add some spring mvc form tag. You can just mix them. 

To ref this tags in jsp file, you need to add the following in beginning of 
ur file
<%@ taglib prefix="form" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" %>

1st tag form we go through is the text field
so in order to add the form u must add a model attribute
It will be the bean for holding the form of data binding

 Inside jsp form,
 in the model attribute u will add <form:input path = "firstName"/>
 When spring mvc loads the form, it will call student.getFirstName()
 
 To read the data, we can use @ModelAttribute("attribute_name")
 and bind it to a variable.
 
 so following the development process and practice:
 - Create student class
 - create student controller class
 - create new html form
 - create form processing code
 - create confirmation page
 
 when u get value of an attribute from the model in html or jsc
 u only need to write attribute.value then spring mvc will
 automatically call Attribute.getValue() method. 

now we move on to drop down tag
its similar to HTML <select> Tag. 
ex in HTML : 	
<select name ="country">
	<option> country_name1 </option>
	<option> country_name2 </option>
	...
<select/>

in spring mvc, the drop down tag is presented by 
<form:select path="name">
	<form:option value ="code" label ="diplay_name"/>
</form:select>
so we can practice with the following Development Process:
- update html form
- update student class 
- update process page

However, you have to write each option one by one and this will be a hassle
instead we can read a list of country with a java class.

!!!OBS!! If you want to read data from a properties file
1.you need to put the file in WEB-INF folder
2.update header section in spring config file
Following example code:
ml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" 
        xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context" 
        xmlns:mvc="http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc" 
        xmlns:util="http://www.springframework.org/schema/util" 
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
        xsi:schemaLocation="
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans     
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd     
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/context     
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd     
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc         
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc/spring-mvc.xsd 
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/util     
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/util/spring-util.xsd">
            
3.After that create a bean in spring config file and add following to use
<util:properties  id="countryOptions" location="classpath:../file_name.properties" />
4.1 import java.util.Map; in your controller class
4.2 inject data with @Value 
ex: @Value("#{countryOptions}") 
private Map<String, String> countryOptions;
4.3 Add those in data in your model
ex: theModel.addAttribute("theCountryOptions", countryOptions); 
4.4 use that attribute in your jsp page with given attribute name
ex: <form:options items="${theCountryOptions}" />
4.5 Remove old reference that doesnt have with the file..
